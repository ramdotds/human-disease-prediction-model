# **Human Disease Prediction Machine Learning Model**

### *introduction*-:
Human Disease is the big problem in this world.Every Goverment Hospitals ,Privet Hospitals, and other jenral cares are filled by the human.According to data of 2023 most of the human already fight some kind of diseases. Some people are ignores of small to small problems and particular time these problems converted to a big disease. This model made for solving these types of problems.


### **Model Use** -:
Please Carefully use this model. Before filling values check all types of featurs/problems and model always return a value. If you use this model for like only cough, fever, hedache, only pain or small problems model can't work. It's only predict a higher disease or always returns a value/disease. You can fill columns using these types of features and know about your disease.Expert opinion: Modeling could contribute to infectious disease control by means of predicting the scales of disease epidemics, indicating the characteristics of disease transmission, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions or policies, and warning or forecasting during the pre-outbreak of diseases.

#### *model can predict these types of disease * -:
'Fungal infection', 'Allergy', 'GERD', 'Chronic cholestasis',
'Drug Reaction', 'Peptic ulcer diseae', 'AIDS', 'Diabetes ',
'Gastroenteritis', 'Bronchial Asthma', 'Hypertension ', 'Migraine',
'Cervical spondylosis', 'Paralysis (brain hemorrhage)', 'Jaundice',
'Malaria', 'Chicken pox', 'Dengue', 'Typhoid', 'hepatitis A',
'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis D', 'Hepatitis E',
'Alcoholic hepatitis', 'Tuberculosis', 'Common Cold', 'Pneumonia',
'Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)', 'Heart attack', 'Varicose veins',
'Hypothyroidism', 'Hyperthyroidism', 'Hypoglycemia',
'Osteoarthristis', 'Arthritis',
'(vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo', 'Acne',
'Urinary tract infection', 'Psoriasis', 'Impetigo'

### **Machin Learning Model** -:
Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms. A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.Machine learning model is improoving his accuracy in the field of medical science.It's not only understand it's create a diemeter of a circle for take him under.Machine Learning model is giving best accuracy with all the factors in this domain and provide connection of between human or science.

### **Human Disease Ditection Machine Learning Model Building Process**
Data load
Data Analysis with Advance Techniques
Data Visualization
Data Preprocession
Feature Analysis or Feature extraction
Feature Scaling
Model Implementation using Skit-Learn
Implement different types of Machine Learning Algorithms
Model Testing
Model Accuracy Testing
Model Accuracy Analysis
Model Save

and Finally
Diployed using Flask

### **Diployment of Model**
Model diployment is the important part of machine learning.
It't has diployed using python library 'Flask'.

### **Conclusion**-:
Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms. A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.
